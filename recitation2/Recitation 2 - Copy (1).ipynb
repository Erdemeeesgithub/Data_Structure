For example, **{4, 3, 1, 0, 2}** and **{3, 1, 4, 2, 0}** are legal permutations, but **{0, 4, 1, 2, 1}** is not, because one number **(1)** is duplicated and another **(3)** is missing. This routine is often used in simulation of algorithms. We assume the existence of a random number generator, r, with method `randInt(i, j)`, that generates integers between **i** and **j** (**i** & **j** included) with equal probability. The following are three algorithms. Please implement the three algorithms by yourself and answer the question of the expected runtime for the three algorithms."
